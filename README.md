Project Name: VoiceFlow
Description:
VoiceFlow is a modern web application that transforms text into natural, clear speech using the browser’s built-in text-to-speech (TTS) capabilities. It offers a rich set of features for users interested in speech synthesis, voice recording, and text extraction from images:
Key Features:
Text-to-Speech (TTS):
Enter or paste any text and have it read aloud using a variety of available voices.
Adjust voice settings such as speed and pitch.
Choose from different voices and languages supported by the browser.
Favorite Voices:
Save custom voice settings (voice, speed, pitch) as favorites for quick access.
Manage (add, use, delete) your favorite voice profiles.
Voice Recording:
Record your own voice samples directly in the browser.
Name, play back, download, and delete your recordings.
Compare your recording with the TTS output for pronunciation practice.
OCR (Optical Character Recognition):
Extract text from images using Tesseract.js.
Upload an image or use your device’s camera to capture text from books, documents, or signs.
Add the extracted text directly to the main text area for TTS or further editing.
User Experience:
Clean, modern, and responsive UI with intuitive controls.
Helpful statistics like word count and estimated reading time.
Example texts for quick testing.
All data (favorites, recordings) is stored locally in the browser for privacy.
Technologies Used:
React for building the user interface.
Tesseract.js for OCR (image-to-text extraction).
Browser APIs for speech synthesis, audio recording, and camera access.
Tailwind CSS (inferred from class names) for styling.
Lucide-react for icons.
Summary:
VoiceFlow is an all-in-one tool for converting text to speech, practicing pronunciation, and extracting text from images, making it useful for language learners, educators, and anyone interested in speech technology.
